# Handwriting Recognition

The goal of this project is to be able to read Handwriting.

## Proposal:
1. detector that can detect lines of Handwriting
  - Yolov8?
2. Detector that can seperate each line into characters
  - Yolov8?
3. Classifier that is able to take a character, and output character likelyhoods.
4. Some sort of spell checker/recursive neural network that can turn lines into sentances.

Start with character Classifier, then step 2

Additions for character Classifier:
  - Need mathematical symbols
  - Need greek lettering
  - Come back to later, first just work on the detectior
